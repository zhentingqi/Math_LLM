Question 2: On a moonless night, three fireflies danced in the evening breeze. They were joined by four less than a dozen more fireflies before two of the fireflies flew away. How many fireflies remained?
Question 2.1: How many fireflies joined?
Answer 2.1: The fireflies were joined by four less than a dozen more fireflies, which are 12 - 4 = 8 fireflies. 
Question 2.2: Now we can answer the question: How many fireflies remained?

Question 3: Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm. Ali gives her sister half of the total money he has and uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. Calculate the amount of money he has after buying the dinner.
Question 3.1: How much money does Ali have in total?

Answer 3.3: After giving his sister the money, Ali has 160 - 80 = 80 dollars left.
Question 3.4: How much money does Ali use to buy dinner?
Answer 3.4: Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. So he uses 80 * 3/5 = 48 dollars to buy dinner.

Answer 3.5: After buying the dinner, Ali has 80 - 48 = 32 dollars left. The answer is 32.

Question 4: A car is driving through a tunnel with many turns. After a while, the car must travel through a ring that requires a total of 4 right-hand turns. After the 1st turn, it travels 5 meters. After the 2nd turn, it travels 8 meters. After the 3rd turn, it travels a little further and at the 4th turn, it immediately exits the tunnel. If the car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring, how far did it have to travel after the 3rd turn?
Question 4.1: How far did the car travel except for the 3rd turn?
Answer 4.1: It travels 5 meters after the 1st, 8 meters after the 2nd, and 0 meters after the 4th turn. It's a total of 5 + 8 + 0 = 13 meters.
Question 4.2: Now we can answer the question: How far did the car have to travel after the 3rd turn?
Answer 4.2: The car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring. It travels 13 meters except for the 3rd turn. So it has to travel 23 - 13 = 10 meters after the 3rd turn. The answer is 10.
